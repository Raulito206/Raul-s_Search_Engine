# Raul-s_Search_Engine
This Search Engine was created by using the method of web scraping. This is my first project that helped me develop the basic skills for the front end.
Used the Django framework in order to use python to code the web scraping.
Web scraping was used to extract data from an exisiting search engine and use that data to bring the links into my search engine.
This is my first beginner project. Creating this project helped me develop the skill to learn new tools fast in order to create something with those tools.
